Overview
--------
The ACCEL-PPTP v1.0 is completly new implementation of PPTP which was written from null.
Userspace daemon has its own PPP implementation, so it does not uses pppd and one process (multi-threaded) manages all connections.
ACCEL-PPTP uses kernel module to increase performance and decrease system usage.
It is not fully tested yet so not recomended to use in production.
Also v1.0 is oriented for servers and does not containes client part, if you need client please use v0.8.x


Features
--------
1.  Modular architecture
2.  PPP controlling connection (PPTP) implemented as module and its possible to implement PPPoE/L2TP as modules too in the future
3.  High-performance multi-threaded IO core
4.  Radius authentication/accounting
5.  Radius DM/CoA extention
6.  Supported authentication types: PAP, CHAP (md5), Microsoft CHAP Extentions (including version 2), not supported - EAP
7.  Supported MPPE, other compression types are not supported
8.  Extensible logging engine with per session logging support, implemented log to file and log to PostgreSQL targets
9.  Extensible user/password database, implemented only Radius target
10. Extensible IP pool, implemented Radius and static pools
11. Supported pppd compatible ip-up/ip-down scripts


Requirment
----------
1. modern linux distribution
2. kernel-2.6.15 or later with PPPoX support
3. cmake-2.6 or later


Compilation and instalation
-----------
Make sure you have configured kernel headers in /usr/src/linux,
or specify other location via KDIR.
1. cd /path/to/accel-pptp-1.0
2. mkdir build
3. cd build
4. cmake -D BUILD_DRIVER=TRUE [ -D KDIR=/usr/src/linux ] [ -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ] [ -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ] ..
5. make
6. make install
KDIR, CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE are optional.


Configuration
-------------
read man accel-pptp.conf


Warning !!!
-----------
1. This driver conflicts with ip_gre driver (in kernel), so make sure that ip_gre is not built-in or loaded at run time.
2. Never mix connections of accel-pptp and original pptpd, before starting accel-pptp make sure that no connections
   of original pptpd exists.
3. If you are switching from <2.6.23 to >=2.6.23 kernel or vi”e-versa then rebuild and reinstall entire package, 
   not just kernel module.


Kernel module
-------------
Kernel module is available as separated module and as patch for kernel.
You can use either separated module or patch for kernel.
There is only patch for 2.6.18 kernel now. If you wish patch for other kernels please mail me.


Thanks
------
Thanks to Kirill Yushkov for debug support and donations.
